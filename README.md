# Database Project – Player Statistics

This project demonstrates how to build and query a normalized database using a real-world dataset of over 19,000 soccer players.

## Overview

- Developed efficient SQL scripts to rapidly extract large datasets.
- Optimized queries for a normalized database schema with over 19,000 entries.
- Improved data accessibility for users needing fast analytical insights.
- Created a Java utility (`CSVtoSQL.java`) to convert CSV datasets to SQL INSERT statements.

## Files Included

- `players_22.csv` – Raw dataset
- `database_script.sql` – SQL script to create and query the database
- `queries.sql` – Additional SQL queries
- `CSVtoSQL.java` – Java program to automate CSV-to-SQL conversion
- `Project_Report.docx` – Project documentation

## Usage

1. Run the SQL script using any standard SQL environment (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).
2. Use the Java program to load additional CSV data if needed.
